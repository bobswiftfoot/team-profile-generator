  ## Description
  This project will prompt the user with a variety of questions, starting about the Manager. Then will have the option to loop and continue asking about as many Enginneers and Interns they would like to add. After the user chooses to end, a HTML page will be created that displays the whole team with clickable links to github and emails.
